# DotNet-UpSkill-Journey

**Learning and implementing concepts of OOPs, C#, .NET, Azure, SQL and real-time projects**

## Overview

This repository is a collection of my learning journey and hands-on implementations in:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- C#
- .NET Framework and .NET Core
- Azure cloud services
- SQL databases
- Real-world project applications

The goal is to build a solid foundation in .NET technologies, gain practical experience, and document progress through code samples and mini-projects.
